  <div class="article-content">
    <p><strong>System</strong> originates from the Greek σύστημα (sýstēma)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, which meant: whole compounded of several parts or members; composition; organized government, constitution;  community, company, committee;  body of soldiers, corps; a boat&rsquo;s crew; machine, apparatus.</p>
<p>The word σύστημα compounded of parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>συν- <em>(syn-)</em> = together</li>
<li>ἵστημι <em>(histēmi)</em> = causal, make to stand; set up</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, the word <em>system</em> is usually used synonymously with <em>order</em>. However, there is another tradition that emerged in the 20th century within the scientific community. Here, a <em>system</em> is understood as a <em>«whole» that is more than the sum of its parts</em>.</p>
<p>For a long time, science relied on breaking things down into pieces to understand them and gain new knowledge. But at a certain point, more and more problems began to emerge that could not be solved this way.</p>
<p>For example, Hans Driesch found that if he grafted the future tail of a newt embryo onto where its leg would normally grow, the putative tail grew into a leg. In other words, the information determining what that part should become was contained outside of it. Therefore, to better understand a <em>part</em>, one must also take into account the <em>whole</em> of which it is a part.</p>
<p>Thus, alongside analysis, science began to value synthesis. Eventually, this would develop into «General Systems Theory»<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>Systems theory is still evolving, and at this moment, there is no single, universally accepted definition of a system. Here are a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A system is an arrangement of parts or elements that together exhibit behaviour or meaning that the individual constituents do not. <em>(The INCOSE Fellows)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system is more than the sum of its parts. It may exhibit adaptive, dynamic, goal-seeking, self-preserving, and sometimes evolutionary behavior. <em>(Donella H. Meadows)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A system is a collection of parts and relationships that forms a whole that is somehow different, having its own personality as it were. <em>(Boardman and Sauser)</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Is everything a system? Most agree that not everything is. Usually, several examples are given, such as a heap <em>(e.g., of sand)</em> or a collection of things <em>(that do not interact)</em> which can be described only by listing its elements. Some even propose a checklist to verify whether what you are dealing with is a system<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha-list">
<li>Can you identify parts? <em>&hellip; and</em></li>
<li>Do the parts affect each other? <em>&hellip; and</em></li>
<li>Do the parts together produce an effect that is different from the effect of each part on its own? <em>&hellip; and perhaps</em></li>
<li>Does the effect, the behavior over time, persist in a variety of circumstances?</li>
</ol>

<p>What is not a system is usually not discussed at length, because mistakes are easy to make here. Not seeing a system in something does not necessarily mean that there isn’t one ☺︎. That is why I prefer an approach that takes the <em>observer</em> into account and makes the definition more formal<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<div class="quote">
    <i class="fas fa-quote-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    <div class="quote-content">
        <p>A <strong>system</strong> consists of three related sets:</p>
<ul>
<li>a set of <strong>elements</strong></li>
<li>a set of <strong>internal interactions</strong> between elements</li>
<li>a set of <strong>external interactions</strong> between one or more elements and the external world; i.e. interactions that can be observed from outside the system.</li>
</ul>

        <span class="quote-by">– Erik W. Aslaksen</span>
    </div>
</div>

<p>That is, what counts as a system is determined by the observer, by the way they describe these three sets. For example: <em>{sun, earth}, {newtonian gravity}, {}</em>; or <em>{rock, scissors, paper}, {rock &gt; scissors, scissors &gt; paper, paper &gt; rock}, {game rules}</em>.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning what is arguably the most mathematical theory of systems developed by Yu. A. Urmantsev<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>. It is built on five basic notions: existence, a set of objects, the single, unity, and sufficiency. The definition of a system in this theory is quite complex, so I will not reproduce it here.</p>
<p>In summary, I support the view that a system is a concept, a mental construct, a tool that helps us make sense of reality.</p>
